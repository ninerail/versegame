# Versinator! #

**Test your Bible literacy.**

This game grabs a random Bible verse from the Bible and asks the player to identify the book that the verse is in.

The biblical text comes from the [English Standard Version API](https://api.esv.org/) provided by [Crossway](https://www.crossway.org/)
